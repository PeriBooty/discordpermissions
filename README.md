A simple module to help with discord permissions.

### Planned Features (subject to change):
- [x] Get required and optional permissions from endpoint and method.
- [ ] Return the permission code as well as the string permissions.
- [ ] Give more specific permissions based on JSON of a request.

- [ ] Function to see if a client (or guild member) has proper permissions for a task.

### Other Quality of Life Features (also subject to change):
- [ ] Clean up and optimize code.
- [ ] Add unit tests.
